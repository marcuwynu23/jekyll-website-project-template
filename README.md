# jekyll-website-project-template

A Jekyll project template is a pre-configured starting point for building static websites using Jekyll, a popular static site generator. It provides a basic structure and set of files that help developers to quickly get started with building their site, including pre-built layouts, styles, and templates.

Typically, a Jekyll project template includes a file structure that organizes the project's content and assets, such as images and stylesheets. It may include a Gemfile for managing the project's dependencies and configuration files for tools like Jekyll, Sass, or JavaScript.

A Jekyll project template may also include pre-written code for common tasks, such as creating blog posts, defining custom collections, or implementing custom plugins. This can save developers time and provide a consistent approach to common problems.

Jekyll project templates can be customized to suit the needs of a particular project. Developers can add or remove files, modify the file structure, and adjust the pre-written code to fit their requirements.

Overall, a Jekyll project template is a valuable tool for developers who want to quickly get started with building static websites using Jekyll while following best practices and a standardized structure.
